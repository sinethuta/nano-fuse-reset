ATMega328p Fuse Reset with Arduino Nano

The NANO FUSE RESET uses the Arduino Nano Microcontroller to reset Fuse bytes and erase
Flash and EEPROM for ATMEGA 328/328P. By using the Arduino Nano with a BJT, the device
will reset the Flash Program memory, EEPROM Data memory, Memory Lock bits, and Fuse bits
in the ATMEGA 328/328P using HIGH VOLTAGE PARALLEL PROGRAMMING.

See Instructional Manual for schematic and more info. 

Connect the Arduino Nano with the ATMega328p on a breadboard. If you prefer, I've also attached the gerber files for the PCB. The PCB is the second iteration from the first vesion that I printed and tested. I've corrected some mistakes and added some components to make it better. Please note, I haven't tested the current version of PCB. 

Also, I have this project on instructables.

Please work on this at your own risk. 
But, I hope this helps!
